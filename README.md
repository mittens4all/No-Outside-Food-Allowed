# No Outside Food Allowed

This behavior pack prevents players from eating food and increasing nutrition and saturation.
Food effects like posion, hunger, and regen, etc. still apply.
Drinking potions, honey bottles, and milk buckets work as they do in vanilla.

## Installing the pack:

Add the No Outside Food Allowed Add-on to your behavior packs on your world. Behavior packs disable achievements, but editing the world with an NBT editor can re-enable achievements when uploading your world to a realm.

Re-enable achievements on either pc or mobile with the free NBT editor [Dovetail](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Dovetail) 

### Food Items in pack that do not give nutrition or saturation.

*Effects like poision, hunger, regen, etc. are still applied.

The `cake` recipe is removed as it is not available as an item in the vanilla samples.

The `suspicious_stew` recipes made from blue orchids and dandelions are removed as they do not give player effects but still give nutrition and saturation even after editing the item.json

Glow berries are not modified. Later releases may prevent players from eating glow berries while maintaining the item's ability to place vines.
